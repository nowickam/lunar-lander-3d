# lunar-lander-3d

The program is a realization of the main assignment for DD1385 Software Engineering course at Kungliga Tekniska HÃ¶gskolan (Stockholm).

Inspired by Atari's Lunar Lander and by Daniel Shiffman's Terrain Generation I decided to create a Java-based game which will emulate the gameplay of Lunar Lander in 3D.

It is an implementation of Model-View/ViewControl architecture with the usage of Observer pattern. A downgrading from Proccessing 3.0 to 2.0 is necessary for an integration with Java Swing elements.

The prerequisites:
- Java environment
- Proccessing 2.0 (iclude core, gluegen, jogl libraries)
